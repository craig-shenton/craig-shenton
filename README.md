# NHSX Projects

|**[Data Lens: a fast-access data search in multiple languages](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/develop-ai/data-lens-a-fast-access-data-search-in-multiple-languages/)**|
|:---|
| I developed and successfully pitched a pilot project for the [NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks](https://nhsx.github.io/skunkworks/data-lens) problem-sourcing event in September 2020. The pitch outlined a common data problem for analysts and researchers across the UK: large volumes of data held on numerous incompatible databases in different organisations. Following a 12-week development phase, a first-stage prototype of the Data Lens was completed. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI technologies, the Data Lens project created a universal search engine for health and social care data catalogues and metadata. The Data Lens joins up data catalogues from NHS Digital, the Health Innovation Gateway, MDXCube, NHS Data Catalogue, PHE Fingertips and the Office for National Statistics. |

|**[Azure Data Engineering Principles](https://nhsx.github.io/AnalyticsUnit/azure-de-principles.html)**|
|:---|
Azure Data Engineering Principles outlined on the NHSX technical gateway site including; Parameterisation, Standardised ETL Design Patterns, Hierarchical Pipeline Orchestration, automated Configuration-as-code and Documentation-as-code. Includes open access and reusable design documentation of <a href="https://nhsx.github.io/au-data-engineering/adfutilities.html">utilities</a> and <a href="https://nhsx.github.io/au-data-engineering/adfpipelines.html">modular pipelines</a> used in the NHSX Analytics Azure environment as well as Python analytical notebooks in <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/au-azure-databricks">Azure Databricks</a>

# NHS England Projects

|**[ICB Place Based Allocation Tool](https://github.com/nhsengland/AIF_Allocation_Tool)**|
|:---|
| I developed a Python Streamlit application to assist Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) perform need based allocation based on defined place. The tool allows a new 'place' to be defined in an ICB as a cluster of GP practices. This allows place to be flexibly defined, whether that is as GP practices in the same Primary Care Network (PCN), Local Authority, or that feed into the same Secondary services. More information on the Allocations process, as well as useful documentation can be found at https://www.england.nhs.uk/allocations/ |
